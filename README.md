# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes Amazon product reviews to determine whether a review is positive or negative. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, it provides a pipeline to preprocess text, build models, and predict sentiment from real-world customer feedback.

## Overview

With the explosion of e-commerce, understanding customer feedback is crucial. This project processes Amazon review data and uses machine learning to classify reviews as positive or negative, helping businesses and researchers extract actionable insights from large volumes of text.

## Approach

The workflow for this project is as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   - Load the raw Amazon review dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of reviews, missing values, and sentiment labels.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Clean the review text: remove punctuation, lowercase, remove stopwords, and perform stemming/lemmatization.
   - Encode sentiment labels for model training.

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Use NLP techniques such as Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.

4. **Model Building and Training**  
   - Split data into training and test sets.
   - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM).
   - Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
   - Visualize results for better interpretation.

6. **Prediction**  
   - Apply the trained model to predict the sentiment of new/unseen reviews.

All code and analysis are contained in [`Amazon reviews model.ipynb`](Amazon%20reviews%20model.ipynb) for easy reproducibility and modification.
